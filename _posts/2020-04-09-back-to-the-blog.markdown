I haven't written any post in here for some time and I want to fix that. For now, it is probably worth mentioning that in the meantime I gave many talks, reviewed some articles in [Paged Out!](https://pagedout.institute/) and wrote two articles:
* A blog post on [Trail of Bits blog: "Understanding Docker container escapes"](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/19/understanding-docker-container-escapes/)
* An article ["`from cpython_exploit_ellipsis import *`" to Paged Out! #01](https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_001_beta1.pdf)

Stay tuned for more content :P.
