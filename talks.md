Below you can see a list of talks or workshops I have given for various events along with slides/videos/materials links. If the particular record has a `[PL]` before it - it means it was made in Polish language.

The convention for a given event is `date - name, location`. The `[lightning talk]` tag means the talk took ~5 minutes and was probably prepared just before presenting it or during the event, as an idea to cotribute some more ;).

### 2024.06.13 [Pykonik Tech Talks #70](https://www.pykonik.org/tech-talks/70/)
* Python specialized bytecode: hacking a Python jail ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13ZiJPzQrNVC5azJPlryfrPtHulCvohts0rZJFepTmis), [video](https://youtu.be/RlNM5n5C_wg?t=5034)) - In this talk we will learn what Python's specialized bytecode is and we will solve a challenge from Angstrom CTF 2024, a capture the flag cybersecurity competition where we had to hack a so called "pycjail returns" which was an attempt to isolate or limit arbitary Python code execution. We will also learn where we can find such jails in real life code and how to do them better (hint: usually, don't do them at all, but if you must...).
  * Including lightning talks about:
    * justCTF 2024 Teaser competition
    * Zero gravity flight

Apart from that, we will look through an insufficient permission check that allowed for kASLR bypass within kernel modules in certain container environments. We will also analyse a not sufficient mitigation in glibc allocator, where changing a few lines of code can make it harder for attackers to exploit buggy applications.

### 2020.04.25 - [Python Pizza, remote @ your couch](https://remote.python.pizza/)
* [lightning talk] sudo python is a trap, use isolated mode ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2530&v=sOXVxjPjF9E), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11HV4e0wqXxl_9xTpHBKfON6oUJP6MBaj9pUjNP6ETdw)) - a showcase of the "Readline module loading in interactive mode" Python security bug :)

Also talked about procfs mount options - hidepid and gid.

### 2019.11.07 - [Akamai Affinity Tech Talks](https://www.akamaiaffinity.com/), Krak√≥w, Poland
* Semantic safety won't save you ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AZp7ovWBwBHm4UcsPsr1zIuwkNiY2AO68WhzK1m1q0w/)) showed a sample of security traps in Python, Go and C programming languages. The topic comes from the fact that both Python and Go handle the hard stuff (e.g. memory/threading/errors/etc) for us and people often consider them "safe" because of the semantics of the language. Though... we still shoot ourself in the foot despite that "safety". Also thanks to [@b0bbytabl3s](https://twitter.com/b0bbytabl3s) for helping up with this topic :).

([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EZlxdYMLykCFd9BYz6ZnnbebKmIs4LCD4xkGixkfwGs/)) - a ~2h talk I gave in polish at AGH; it is a deep dive into CPython and its VM. From the original description: "We will learn about CPython bytecode, PYC files, how to disassemble a Python function or decompile it back from bytecode to Python code. We will look at the flow between launching and executing a Python script. We will also go through CPython VM execution by emulating the execution of a short Python function.".

* [lightning talk] Pyyaml WT# (no slides) - a rant about PyYaml module: there was a 4.1 relase that changed `safe_load` into `load` which was [reverted](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/commit/ccc40f3e2ba384858c0d32263ac3e3a6626ab15e) and [removed](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/192) from [pypi...](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/190), then 5.1 was supposed to make `load` safer by default but not necessarily disallowing it to deserialize Python objects, [so it is stil insecure](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/321).
* [lightning talk] A story of a 3d nickname ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MhsfHxMWtfedxBPWIgE53oHb-5WOg82RahIqKafuGSo/, [video](https://youtu.be/OFOHSCnvUwQ?t=6)) - a story about '3d' origin in my nickname and something about IRC communities o/.

Note: What does privileged mean?

### 2016-2017 - for various university classes assignments at AGH UST, Krak√≥w, Poland
* [PL] SQLi, XSS, CSRF: some vulnerabilities from web applications - [slides](https://github.com/disconnect3d/websec_presentation/blob/master/websec.pdf) - presented and demoed about some vulns and exploitation techniques for web applications. Co-authored with Magdalena Jaroszy≈Ñska.
* [PL] 1/3: Reverse engineering and finding and exploitting bugs in native apps for x86/x86\_64 - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HKuW69NFD2IFSdkdD7ul3aWriHXHDLfPOvJV0wsiwH0) - introduction presentation to show up my master thesis topic for a diploma seminar. Described few low level concepts - processor registers, x86 assembly basic instructions, the `call`, `leave`, `ret` instrtuctions flow and some bug sources in applications.
* [PL] 2/3: Reverse engineering and finding and exploitting bugs in native apps for x86/x86\_64 - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rWcOBc2dSUCzCfc1IXQSUWYopQ6eX4Cgc4yLg4cpA5Y/) - mid-semester presentation; showed a process of solving a reverse-engineering CTF challenge: from inspecting the binary, deassembling it, decompiling it via IDA Pro, inspecting program's strings, finding the winning condition, dynamic analysis via debbugging to find out which global values corresponds to which game objects and solving winning-condition equations through Z3 theorem prover. The talk also shown how code instrumentation, here address sanitizer, helps finding bugs, how a stack-buffer-overflow can be exploited, how to find out ELF binaries mitigations and various techniques an attacker can use to exploit bugs (shellcodes, overwriting GOT, ROP chains).
* [PL] 3/3: Reverse engineering and finding and exploitting bugs in native apps for x86/x86\_64 - [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j5ws3G7YLxeezjmPrEG9Q-iFD3GLsrpXi1wW7h7NAwo/) - a summary presentation where I showed how ELF maps to memory, listed processes for finding bugs, described fuzzing and symbolic execution, showed an interesting heap-related bug and more.
