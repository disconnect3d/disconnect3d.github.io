  * [Never ever to be fooled to pay ransomware! – CTFZone 2018 Quals](https://programistamag.pl/programista-7-2018-74/) - a write-up of a reverse-engineering CTF challenge where we had to decrypt an Android ransomware. Solved and written together with Paweł Łukasik, who also wrote a [write-up on his blog](https://ctfs.ghost.io/never-ever-be-fooled-to-pay-ransomware-ctfzone2018/).
